# 👋 Welcome, I'm Pcbilgilisi

From the quiet streets of Boyabat to the depths of digital systems,  
my journey is one of resilience, curiosity, and creation.

I'm a high school student in software development,  
but most of what I know comes from self-teaching, experimentation, and community building.

## 💻 My Digital Identity

- Built a custom Linux distribution: **UIOSLinux**  
- Optimized and debloated Windows and Android systems  
- Published technical content via GitHub Pages and Blogger  
- Founded digital communities: **Windows Çetesi**, **Techolaycılar**

## 🧠 My Philosophy

> “The right person in the wrong place can still leave the right digital legacy.”

I’ve faced isolation, misunderstanding, and limited opportunities.  
But I turned those into strategy, creativity, and connection.

I’m not just a hardware guy.  
I’m a digital storyteller.

## 🎯 My Mission

- Expand my reach with English content and international visibility  
- Leave behind a meaningful digital archive: blogs, manifestos, technical guides  
- Inspire others from small towns to pursue tech fearlessly
