# Pcbilgilisi — Digital Technologist & Community Builder 🌐

Welcome to my digital space. I'm Pcbilgilisi — a self-taught technologist from Boyabat, Turkey, where tech opportunities are limited but curiosity and resilience thrive.

## 🧠 My Journey

- From school isolation to digital leadership  
- From gaming to deep system optimization  
- From being called “asosyal” to mentoring others in online tech communities

## 🔧 What I Build

- 🐧 **UIOSLinux** – Custom Linux distro based on EndeavourOS  
- 📱 **Mobile OS Modding** – ROM installation, debloating, and performance tweaks  
- 🖥️ **Windows/Linux Optimization** – System cleanup and speed enhancement  
- 🌍 **Community Leadership** – Founder of *Windows Çetesi* and *Techolaycılar*  
- 📚 **Content Creation** – Blogger, GitHub Pages, and YouTube tutorials

## 🎯 My Mission

- To prove that talent isn’t bound by geography
