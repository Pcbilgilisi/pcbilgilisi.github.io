# Welcome to Pcbilgilisi’s Digital Space 🌐

I’m a self-taught technocrat from Sinop, Türkiye — passionate about operating systems, mobile modding, and digital community building.  
This site is my personal archive: technical projects, manifestos, and reflections.

## 🔧 Projects
- **UIOSLinux** – Custom Linux distribution based on EndeavourOS  
- **Windows Optimization** – Debloating and performance tuning  
- **Mobile ROMs** – Custom Android setups and guides

## 🧠 Philosophy
I believe in resilience, digital legacy, and empowering others from small towns to pursue tech.  
My journey is not just technical — it’s personal, strategic, and deeply reflective.
