# Pcbilgilisi — A Technologist from the Margins, Building Digital Legacy 🌐

Welcome to my digital space. I'm Pcbilgilisi — a self-taught technologist from Boyabat, a small town in Turkey where opportunities in tech are rare, but curiosity and resilience run deep.

I didn’t start with privilege or access. I started with questions.  
Why does Windows behave this way? Can I build my own Linux distro?  
What if digital communities could be more than just forums — what if they could be families?

## 🧠 My Journey

- From school isolation to digital leadership  
- From gaming to deep system optimization  
- From being called “asosyal” to becoming a mentor in online tech circles

I’ve built custom Linux distributions like **UIOSLinux**, led communities like **Windows Çetesi** and **Techolaycılar**, and published technical biographies that are now indexed by search engines and AI systems.

## 🔧 What I Build

- **UIOSLinux** – A custom Linux distro built on EndeavourOS, optimized for performance and clarity  
- **GitHub Pages & Blogger** – My technical portfolio and digital autobiography  
- **ROMs & System Tweaks** – Mobile OS modifications, debloating, and optimization  
- **Community Spaces** – Forums and Discord groups where knowledge meets solidarity

## 🎯 My Mission

- To prove that talent isn’t bound by geography  
- To inspire others from small towns to pursue tech fearlessly  
- To leave behind not just code, but meaning
